BOOKSPOT is a social site where the reviews of any book from the respective readers are displayed, which helps other readers to pick books wisely by their experience.
<br><br>
Not only this, you too can upload your views about any book you had read and it may help someone by choosing theirs...
<br><br>
We have divided each book with a catagory so you can find the book which suites your genre.
<br><br>
We have provided a feedback form for our users to let us know any suggestions and any issues regarding our website. We will always accept our users feedback to make our website more and more efficient.
